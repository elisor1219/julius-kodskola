 * Arrays are like lists of values. Arrays can contain any value
 * 
 * Here we have a bunch of different shipment crates, all with different weights.
 * Their weights are stored below in an array named `crateWeights`.
 * Your second task is to use a loop to figure the average weight of all the crates combined.
 * The result should be stored in a variable named `averageWeight`
