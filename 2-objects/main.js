/**
 * Objects have properties. Say we have an object that looks like this: { fruit: 'apple' }
 * This object has a property named fruit, and the value of fruit is 'apple'.
 * If we have this object stored in a variable named `tree`, we can access the value 'apple'
 * by writing `tree.fruit` and this gives us 'apple'.
 * 
 * Your first task is to add lukes height and mass, and then store the
 * result in a variable named `lukes_combined_height_and_mass`.
 *
