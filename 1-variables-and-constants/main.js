/**
 * Your task is to create two variables. One named `name` and the other named `age`.
 * `name` should be a string and contain your name, with the first letter capitalized.
 * `age` should be a number and contain your age.
 * 
 * Hint: You can define variables using the `var`, `let` and `const` keywords.
 *       Though you should avoid using `var`, we'll get into that later
 * Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types
